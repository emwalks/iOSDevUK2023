Creating a Design System With Sift UI
Daniel Tull

Note from speaker about slides for talk:

"My slides are an app. Currently the only navigation is tapping the right half of the slide to go forwards and left to go backwards.

It's a SwiftUI app (you can find the source on GitHub) using rough a little library I wrote called SlideUI. In case anyone was wondering why the text of the buttons needed to be so large!
