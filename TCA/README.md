# TCA

- Not a SwiftUI Framework but wrotten with swiftUI in mind
- More than just a description of a pattern / how to solve a problem
- Is an actual framework, and can be applied to bigger than a single feature

- State
    - Where your data lives
    - State and view already bound
    - When the state is updated, the view gets rerendered

- Actions 
    - almost always described as an enum
    - only way for the view to interact with TCA code
